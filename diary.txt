Diary for Chris Webb

I originally had my diary/log in my git repository, but then my project
folder (including the .git directory) was deleted.

From memory:
Started the project 2 weeks ago. Did very little work
except to setup the basic css layout.

About 1 week ago I spend around 4 hours setting up some of the pages.
26/05/12 - Refactored the project. 2 hours.

Actual Diary:
28/05/12 - Working on the final features. 5 hours.
29/05/12 - Started work at 10:15 stopped at 11:45.
29/05/12 - Got a few more features working. 2 hours. 
29/05/12 - Aiming to get the rest of the assignment working:
            * Matching
            * Edit Profile
            * Password Recovery
           started at 8pm. Finished at 11:30.
           Didn't finish because at 11:20pm an entire file
           was corrupted (I hadn't remade my damn git
           repository yet...).
30/05/12 - When I submitted the project just before midnight
           the database wasn't updating and the matching wasn't on.
           Spent an hour fixing this, then submitted.
